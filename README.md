# OTA
In this project, our team comprising Gurukarthi K C (myself), Gurukumar K C and Hanuman M created a Network-layer based model working on TCP, to create a peer-to-peer and client-server based architecture for OTA updates for automobiles. The system had the following features:
1. Peer to peer checking for update version
2. Peer to peer sharing of firmware updates
3. Server to client updates
4. Roll back and resumption in case of network failure
5. CRC checking and checksum

The working of the system was simulated using two x86 architecture based systems over WiFi6.
